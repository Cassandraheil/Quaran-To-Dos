# Quaran-To-Dos

## Goals
Quaran-To-Dos is an app designed for the 2020 Coronavirus Crisis. With everyone stuck at home, life and get very boring and tedious, making it easy for mental health to decrease. The Quarenteam wanted to do our best to help! Thus Quaren-To-Dos came to life. The app is designed to keep users connected and motivated by giving them a platform to keep all their to-dos in order. 

## Utilizing Our App
Using this app is user-friendly. The user can submit a username to store their todo list in. Then simply select what they would like to do and search for a movie, book, video game, or song and add the option to their list. The number of to-dos done by all the users will show up on the timeline so they can stay connected and motivated to get that number higher than the day before.
